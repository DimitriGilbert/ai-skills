# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these guidelines when submitting pull requests.

## Adding Items

- Only add items that you personally recommend or have thoroughly researched.
- Ensure all entries are objectively described without marketing language.
- Follow the existing format: `- [Project Name](https://github.com/user/project#readme) - Description.`
- All descriptions must end with a period.
- Add new entries to the bottom of the appropriate category.

## Requirements

- Entries must be actively maintained.
- Projects must have documentation.
- No archived, deprecated, or unmaintained projects.
- Repositories must be public.

## Formatting

- Use title case for project names.
- Include `#readme` at the end of GitHub links.
- Start descriptions with uppercase letters.
- Keep descriptions concise but informative.
- Avoid superlatives like "best", "amazing", "revolutionary".

## Pull Request Process

1. Check if your contribution duplicates existing entries.
2. Ensure your entry follows the formatting guidelines.
3. Test that all links work correctly.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear title describing the change.

## Style Guidelines

- **Be objective:** Describe what the project does, not how great it is.
- **Be specific:** "A CLI tool for X" is better than "A great tool".
- **Be concise:** One sentence per entry is usually sufficient.
- **Be accurate:** Verify claims about features and capabilities.
