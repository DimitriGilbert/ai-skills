CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or
a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
  and translate a Work;

 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or voice
  depicted in a Work;

 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
  in a Work;

 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes),
in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
in any current or future medium and for any purpose, and (iv) for any other
purpose, and without any conditions or limitations, whether expressed or
implied, including, without limitation, any implied conditions or
representations of ownership, authority, non-infringement, merchantability or
fitness for a particular purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected party a royalty-
free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
in any current or future medium and for any purpose, and (iv) for any other
purpose, with the rights to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
communicate, and translate a Work, and to make and use, but not patent,
Modifications, including, without limitation, the right to make Modifications
in any manner or form, and the right to sublicense, have and allow others to
exercise, all of the foregoing rights. For the avoidance of doubt, the
license granted hereunder does not include any patent rights to the Work,
and no patent license is granted by Affirmer or necessary for the exercise of
the rights granted hereunder.

4. Limitations and Disclaimer. The licenses and rights granted under CC0 do
not, and are not intended to, supersede or limit any use or exercise of
rights under separate terms, conditions, licenses or agreements governing use
or exercise of rights in the Work or any exceptions or limitations to
Copyright and Related Rights that apply to particular uses of the Work, such
as fair use or fair dealing, or any other copyright exception or limitation
under applicable law. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in
contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally disclaims all representations, warranties and
covenants, whether express or implied, including, without limitation, any
representations, warranties and covenants regarding non-infringement, absence
of latent or other defects, accuracy, completeness, merchantability, fitness
for a particular purpose, adequacy, suitability, lack of viruses or bugs or
defects, title, ownership, quiet enjoyment, and any warranties or covenants
arising from course of dealing, course of performance, or usage of trade.
Affirmer makes the CC0 Waiver and License available to recipients of the Work
expressly, without any representation or warranty of any kind, whether express,
implied, statutory or otherwise. This includes, without limitation, any
representations or warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness
for a particular purpose. Nothing in this CC0 Waiver and License represents or
warrants that the Affirmer has the right to use the names or trademarks of
any third party.

Unless expressly stated otherwise, the person who associated a work with this
deed makes no warranties about the work, and disclaims liability for all uses
of the work, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

When using or citing the work, you should not imply endorsement by the author
or the affirmer.
