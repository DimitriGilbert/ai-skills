## Creation process

use subagent to do research, get them to write complete thorough articles on the knowledge you want to gain
get them to use both Context7 and web search to gather information
they should always reference research origin (url, library+search query for context7) in notes when producing content so things can be verified/updated

take you time and iterate by consulting sub agents (multiple/specialized if needed) to review and comment all or part of your work, including for plans
remember to give them the context they need to work and select proper agent !

plan carefully and do not hesitate to revisit you plan in light of knowledge aquired through research or feedback

Once you have a carefully crafted plan, save it to a file and get a subagent to execute it

Review the agent work by using subagents to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement and finish the work with the help of a subagent.

you and sub agents can save thing in an organized fashion in .search-data/ dir

Giving proper context to your agents is very important for a good outcome so you need to thorough but concise, point to resources and ask them to save their work in the .search-data/ dir so you can reference it later as well

sub agents can clon reference repository in their search folder to have access to source if needed

tell agents to use existing skills to help them execute the work properly
