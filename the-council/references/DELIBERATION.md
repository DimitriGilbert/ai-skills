# Deliberation Patterns

This document covers structured approaches to facilitating discussions between councillors when they disagree.

## When to Deliberate

### Good Candidates for Deliberation
- Councillors have clearly different positions
- Disagreement appears evidence-based (not just values)
- The topic is critical to the decision
- Additional discussion could reveal common ground

### Poor Candidates for Deliberation
- Positions differ due to fundamental values (e.g., speed vs. security)
- Councillors are repeating the same points
- The disagreement is about preferences, not facts
- Time cost exceeds value of additional clarity

## Deliberation Formats

### 1. Position Exchange

**Best for:** Two councillors with opposing views on a specific point

**Format:**
```
[Specialist A] and [Specialist B]: Please address your disagreement on:

[Specific point of disagreement]

Round 1:
- Specialist A: Present your position and strongest evidence (3-4 sentences)
- Specialist B: Present your position and strongest evidence (3-4 sentences)

Round 2:
- Specialist A: Respond to B's points directly - what do you agree/disagree with?
- Specialist B: Respond to A's points directly - what do you agree/disagree with?

Round 3:
- Each: What evidence, if presented, would change your mind?
```

**Chair's role:**
- Ensure each stays within format
- Identify convergence points
- Stop rounds if diminishing returns

**Expected outcome:**
- Consensus on some aspects
- Clear articulation of remaining disagreement
- Understanding of what would resolve the disagreement

### 2. Evidence Review

**Best for:** Disagreements where one or both parties lack complete information

**Format:**
```
[Specialist A] and [Specialist B]: You disagree on [topic].

Let's review the evidence together:

Phase 1 - Evidence sharing:
- Each: Share the specific sources supporting your position
- Include URLs, docs, search queries, etc.

Phase 2 - Joint review:
- Review each other's sources
- Identify which sources you both accept as credible
- Note sources you question and why

Phase 3 - Re-assessment:
- Given the shared evidence, do your positions shift?
- What evidence is still missing?
```

**Chair's role:**
- Ensure sources are specific and accessible
- Facilitate joint source review
- Identify gaps in shared understanding

**Expected outcome:**
- Shared factual foundation
- Reduced disagreement based on better information
- Identification of what further research is needed

### 3. Scenario Analysis

**Best for:** Disagreements about future outcomes or risks

**Format:**
```
[Specialist A] and [Specialist B]: You disagree on [predicted outcome/topic].

Let's analyze specific scenarios:

Scenario 1: [Specific situation or condition]
- Specialist A: What do you expect to happen? Why?
- Specialist B: What do you expect to happen? Why?
- Compare: Where do you converge/diverge?

Scenario 2: [Different specific situation]
[Repeat analysis]

Scenario 3: [Edge case or stress test]
[Repeat analysis]

Synthesis:
- Under what conditions do you agree?
- What conditions cause divergence?
```

**Chair's role:**
- Define scenarios that test the disagreement
- Track agreement/disagreement across scenarios
- Identify the "it depends" conditions

**Expected outcome:**
- Nuanced understanding of when each position applies
- Conditional agreement ("I agree IF X")
- Clear articulation of the disagreement's boundary conditions

### 4. Trade-off Exploration

**Best for:** Fundamental value conflicts (e.g., security vs. UX, speed vs. quality)

**Format:**
```
[Specialist A] and [Specialist B]: Your positions reflect different priorities.

Let's explicitly explore the trade-offs:

Phase 1 - Value articulation:
- Specialist A: What value are you prioritizing? What are you willing to trade off?
- Specialist B: What value are you prioritizing? What are you willing to trade off?

Phase 2 - Quantify (if possible):
- Can we measure or estimate the trade-offs?
- What are the costs/benefits of each approach?

Phase 3 - Hybrid approaches:
- Are there solutions that address both values partially?
- Can we satisfy both values with a hybrid approach?

Phase 4 - Recommendation:
- Given the trade-offs, what's your recommendation?
- Acknowledge the other value in your recommendation
```

**Chair's role:**
- Make implicit values explicit
- Encourage creative hybrid solutions
- Ensure trade-offs are acknowledged

**Expected outcome:**
- Clear understanding of what values are in conflict
- Acknowledgement that there's no "perfect" answer
- Recommendation that balances competing values (or explicit choice of one value)

### 5. Small Group Consensus

**Best for:** 3-5 councillors with diverse perspectives

**Format:**
```
Gathering: [Specialist A], [Specialist B], [Specialist C]

Topic: [Question requiring multiple perspectives]

Round 1 - Positions (3 sentences max each):
- Each councillor: State your position briefly

Round 2 - Convergence mapping:
- Identify points where multiple councillors agree
- Identify unique perspectives

Round 3 - Targeted discussion:
- Focus on areas of disagreement
- Specialist A and B discuss [specific disagreement]
- Specialist B and C discuss [specific disagreement]
- [Continue for key disagreements]

Round 4 - Synthesis:
- Each: What, if anything, changed your mind?
- Chair: Map the final consensus landscape

Round 5 - Recommendations:
- Each: Given the discussion, what's your recommendation?
- Look for convergence or distinct camps
```

**Chair's role:**
- Keep rounds focused and brief
- Map agreement/disagreement in real-time
- Prevent domination by one voice
- Stop when convergence is clear or diminishing returns hit

**Expected outcome:**
- Shared understanding across perspectives
- Partial or full consensus on some aspects
- Clear mapping of where consensus wasn't reached

### 6. Devil's Advocate

**Best for:** Testing if a position is robust or if the council has blind spots

**Format:**
```
[Specialist A] has proposed [position].

[Specialist B]: Your role is devil's advocate. Challenge this position:

1. Identify the weakest assumptions in A's position
2. Present the strongest counter-arguments
3. Propose alternative approaches

[Specialist A]: Respond to B's challenges
- Which challenges are valid?
- Which are based on misunderstandings?
- How would you address valid challenges?

Chair: Assess whether A's position holds up or needs revision
```

**Chair's role:**
- Ensure devil's advocate is thorough but fair
- Distinguish between weak challenges and strong challenges
- Assess if the position survived scrutiny

**Expected outcome:**
- Strengthened position (if it survived scrutiny)
- Revised position (if valid weaknesses were found)
- Abandoned position (if critical flaws emerged)

## Deliberation Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These

**Repeating the same points:**
- Problem: Councillors restating positions without new information
- Solution: Chair explicitly asks "What NEW evidence or perspective do you have?"

**Talking past each other:**
- Problem: Councillors not directly addressing each other's points
- Solution: Use "Respond to [other councillor]'s argument about X" format

**Dominating the discussion:**
- Problem: One councillor speaks much more than others
- Solution: Chair enforces equal time/turn limits

**Scope creep:**
- Problem: Discussion expands to unrelated topics
- Solution: Chair gently redirects to the specific disagreement

**Personalizing disagreements:**
- Problem: Disagreement becomes about the councillor, not the position
- Solution: Chair intervenes: "We're discussing ideas, not people"

**Chasing perfect consensus:**
- Problem: Continuing deliberation after positions are clear
- Solution: Chair accepts that reasonable people can disagree

## Decision Frameworks Post-Deliberation

### When to Accept Dissent

Consensus isn't always possible or desirable. Accept dissent when:

1. **Values differ fundamentally:** Security vs. speed, simplicity vs. flexibility
2. **Uncertainty is irreducible:** Genuine uncertainty about future outcomes
3. **Time constraints:** Deliberation cost exceeds additional clarity value
4. **Reasonable disagreement:** Multiple valid approaches exist

### Presenting Divergent Views

When consensus isn't reached, present:

```markdown
## Decision Analysis

### Areas of Consensus
[Where councillors agreed]

### Areas of Divergence

#### Position A: [Summary]
**Held by:** [Specialists]
**Key evidence:** [Sources]
**Best for:** [When this approach is preferable]

#### Position B: [Summary]
**Held by:** [Specialists]
**Key evidence:** [Sources]
**Best for:** [When this approach is preferable]

### Chair's Recommendation

Given the divergence, I recommend:

[Recommendation that either:]
- [Chooses one position with rationale]
- [Proposes a hybrid approach]
- [Defers to a specific stakeholder's judgment]
- [Recommends gathering more information]

### What Would Change This Decision
[What evidence or circumstances would cause a different choice]

- [ ] Is everyone being heard?
- [ ] Are we making progress toward understanding?

After deliberation:
- [ ] Did we reach consensus or clarify disagreement?
- [ ] Is the outcome documented clearly?
- [ ] Do all councillors feel their views were heard?
