# OpenTUI Research - Completion Report

**Task:** Conduct thorough research on OpenTUI to create comprehensive skill(s)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Date:** January 17, 2026
**Researcher:** Claude (Sonnet 4.5)

---

## Executive Summary

I have successfully completed comprehensive research on OpenTUI and created detailed documentation to support the creation of specialized OpenTUI skills. The research covers all aspects of OpenTUI including core concepts, architecture, components, integrations, real-world applications, and community resources.

### Key Deliverable
**Recommendation:** Create THREE specialized skills rather than one monolithic skill:
1. **opentui** - Core development with imperative API
2. **opentui-react** - React integration and patterns
3. **opentui-projects** - Project scaffolding and examples

This approach provides focused, relevant assistance while maintaining flexibility for different use cases.
