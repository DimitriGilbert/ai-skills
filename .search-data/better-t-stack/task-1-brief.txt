# Task 1: Documentation Deep Dive Analysis

You are a specialist in analyzing documentation and extracting actionable information. Your task is to thoroughly analyze all documentation files in the Better-T-Stack CLI repository to create comprehensive documentation for skill creation.

## Context
I am researching the Better-T-Stack CLI tool to create comprehensive documentation for skill creation. The repository is located at https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack and has been cloned to /home/didi/workspace/Code/skills/.search-data/better-t-stack/repo/.

## Your Mission

Read and analyze ALL documentation files in `apps/web/content/docs/` and extract:
1. Main topics covered in each file
2. Key configuration options mentioned
3. Usage patterns and examples
4. Best practices
5. Common workflows
6. Edge cases and special considerations

## Files to Analyze

Main Documentation:
- index.mdx
- bts-config.mdx (already read - reference this)
- project-structure.mdx
- faq.mdx
- contributing.mdx
- analytics.mdx

CLI Documentation:
- cli/index.mdx (already read - reference this)
- cli/options.mdx (already read - reference this)
- cli/compatibility.mdx (already read - reference this)
- cli/prompts.mdx
- cli/programmatic-api.mdx

Guides:
- guides/index.mdx
- guides/cloudflare-alchemy.mdx

## Deliverables

Create TWO comprehensive markdown files in `.search-data/better-t-stack/`:

### 1. best-practices.md

Structure your document with these sections:
- Choosing the Right Stack (For Full-Stack Apps, Backend-Only, Frontend-Only, Native Apps)
- Configuration Management (bts.jsonc Management, Environment Variables, Project Updates)
- Usage Patterns (init vs add Commands, Workflow Patterns, Common Workflows)
- Development Practices (Testing, Deployment, Maintenance)
- Performance Considerations (Runtime Selection, Database Selection, Addon Selection)
- Security Best Practices (Authentication Setup, Database Security, Deployment Security)

### 2. common-patterns.md

Structure your document with these sections:
- Init Command Patterns (Standard Full-Stack Setup, Minimal Setup, Multi-Frontend Setup)
- Add Command Patterns (Adding Addons, Adding Deployment, Updating Configuration)
- Stack Combinations (Recommended Combinations, Common Use Cases, Example Stacks)
- Workflow Patterns (Development Workflow, Testing Workflow, Deployment Workflow)

## Critical Requirements

1. **ALWAYS reference your sources** - Include the specific file path for every piece of information (e.g., "Source: apps/web/content/docs/cli/options.mdx, line 45-60")
2. **Provide concrete examples** - Include actual command examples and code snippets from the documentation
3. **Be comprehensive** - Don't miss any important information
4. **Organize logically** - Make it easy to find information
5. **Use markdown properly** - Use headers, lists, code blocks, and tables effectively
6. **Cross-reference** - Link between sections when relevant

## Research Sources

- Repository: https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack
- Local clone: /home/didi/workspace/Code/skills/.search-data/better-t-stack/repo/
- Documentation directory: apps/web/content/docs/

## How to Proceed

1. Navigate to the cloned repository
2. Read each documentation file carefully using the Read tool
3. Extract key information for each file
4. Organize the information according to the deliverable structures
5. Save your findings to the specified files
6. Reference all sources with specific file paths

## Quality Checklist

Before submitting, verify:
- [ ] All documentation files have been read
- [ ] Both deliverable files are complete
- [ ] Every claim has a source reference
- [ ] Concrete examples are included
- [ ] Information is well-organized
- [ ] Markdown formatting is correct
- [ ] No critical information is missing

Focus on information that would be useful for creating a skill - practical, actionable, and comprehensive.
